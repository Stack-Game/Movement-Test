*Try and stack the blocks all the way to the top.*


# Introduction

Stack is a mobile game for Android, where the goal is to align sets of blocks \
as much as possible.

# Usage 

Choose a difficulty level from one of the three options (easy, medium, or hard) \
and then a screen will appear with three moving blocks at the bottom. \

Touch the screen to freeze the current row of blocks in place and a new set will start \
moving above the previous row.

The game will continue as long as the newest set of blocks \
to freeze has at least one block above the previous row. \
If the user fails to align the current row of blocks above any of the \
previous row, the game will end and a "game over" message will be displayed. \

If the user only manages to align one or two blocks directly above the previous row \
only the number of blocks aligned will freeze in place and it will become harder to \
align the next row.

The blocks will continue to speed up. If the user continues to stack blocks such that they reach\
the top of the screen, a congratulatory message will be displayed.

Regardless of outcome, the user will then be taken back to the start screen and can play again.
